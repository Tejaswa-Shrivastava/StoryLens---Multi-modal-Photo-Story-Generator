StoryLens – Multi-modal Photo Story Generator is an AI-powered project that turns photos into engaging stories or poems with optional audio narration. Here's what it's about:

📸 What It Does:
Photo Upload:
Users upload any image – e.g., a vacation pic, birthday snap, or random memory.

AI-Powered Story Generation:
The image is analyzed using Microsoft's Kosmos-2, a vision-language model that understands both image content and text. It creates a creative story or poem based on what it sees in the photo.

Voice Narration (Optional):
Using Coqui's XTTS-v2, the text output is converted into a natural-sounding audio narration — which can even mimic a specific voice or emotion.
🔁 Workflow Summary:
Input: User uploads an image.
